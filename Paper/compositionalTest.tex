We now consider an alternative approach to analysing the combination of an alt
and some channels.  
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item We show that a single channel (in isolation) is consistent with a more
  abstract model, which we call |IdealisedChannel|;

\item We likewise show that an alt (in isolation) is consistent with a more
  abstract model, which we call |IdealisedAlt|;

\item We show that the combination of an |IdealisedAlt| and several
  |Idealised|\-|Channel|s satisfies the correctness property from the previous
  section.
\end{enumerate}
%
This allows us to deduce that the combination of an alt and several channels
satisfies the same property.  

The fundamental reason why such an approach works is that CSP refinement is
compositional: if $P \refinedby Q$ then $C(P) \refinedby C(Q)$ for any
context~$C$ defined using CSP operators~\cite{awr:UCS}.  This means that if we
refine one component of a system, we also refine the whole system.
Alternatively, if we show that a component refines some specification, we can
replace that component by its specification in the analysis of the whole
system. 

This approach scales better than that in the previous section, so allows us to
deduce correctness for a larger number of threads.

The analysis is complicated by the following issue.  A channel works correctly
under the assumption that any alt that interacts with it follows the alt
protocol.  However, if the alt does not follow the protocol, then the channel
can act incorrectly.  For example, if an alt tries to register \emph{twice}
with a channel, or tries to deregister without having previously registered,
then the implementation throws an exception, and the CSP model diverges.
Likewise, the alt works correctly under the assumption that channels follow
the alt protocol, but may act incorrectly otherwise.

When we analyse a channel in isolation, we cannot assume that its environment
(an alt) follows the protocol; and when we analyse an alt in isolation, we
cannot assume that its environment (channels) follows the environment: to make
these assumptions would be circular reasoning. 

The issue of components of a system making assumptions about other components
has been widely considered before, for example using the techniques of
rely-guarantee~\cite{jones-83} and
assumption-commitment~\cite{misra-chandy-81,PJ-91}.  Our approach shows how to
use CSP model checking in such a situation. 


Our approach is as follows.  Our idealised model of a channel will detect if
its environment breaks the alt protocol, and if so allow arbitrary behaviour.
Thus testing whether the model of a channel refines this specification is
equivalent to testing whether it satisfies the specification when the
environment does follow the protocol.  More precisely, we will produce a
process |IdealisedChannel| that describes allowed behaviour when the
environment does follow the protocol, but produces an \emph{error event} from
a set |Errors|$_C$ if the environment breaks the protocol.  We then test
(Section~\ref{sec:idealisedChan}) whether the channel model refines the
process
%
\begin{cspm}
(IdealisedChannel [|Errors£$_C$£|> Any) \ Errors£$_C$£
\end{cspm}
%
where |Any| allows arbitrary behaviour (the definition depends upon the
semantic model we are using).  Thus the above process acts like~|Any| after an
error event. 

Likewise, we build an idealised model of an alt that allows arbitrary
behaviour if its environment breaks the protocol
(Section~\ref{sec:idealisedAlt}).  The model will be of the form
%
\begin{cspm}
(IdealisedAlt [|Errors£$_A$£|> Any) \ Errors£$_A$£
\end{cspm}
%
where |IdealisedAlt| describes allowed behaviour when the environment does
follow the protocol, but performs an event from~|Errors|$_A$ if the
environment breaks the protocol.

We can then consider the combination of |IdealisedAlt| and several instances
of |IdealisedChannel|.  Part of the analysis
(Section~\ref{sec:combiningIdealised}) will show that no events from
$\CSPMM{Errors}_C \union \CSPMM{Errors}_A$ occur: each component follows the
alt protocol, provided the other has not previously broken the protocol.  But
we can also show that this combination satisfies the correctness property from
the previous section, allowing us to deduce that the corresponding combination
of an alt and channels satisfies that property.
