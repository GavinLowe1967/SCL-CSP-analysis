\section{Modelling and analysing a  synchronous channel}
\label{sec:syncchan}

\inlineScala

In this section, we consider the operation of a single synchronous channel,
without considering interaction with alts.

We start by considering just the send (``\SCALA{!}'') and receive
(``\SCALA{?}'')  operations.  We outline the implementation for these
operations, how we model them in CSP, and then how we analyse their
correctness.  In later subsections, we extend to include the timed operations
and the closing of channels; for the moment we elide details related to those
operations or to the use of alts.

The implementation is based on a monitor (more precisely, using an
implementation of monitors within the SCL library).  All operations are
carried out while holding the monitor's lock.  In addition, the implementation
uses a number of \emph{conditions}: one thread can wait on a condition until
another thread signals on the same condition.

The implementation uses a variable \SCALA{value} to store the value that a
thread is currently trying to send (if any).  Further, it uses a variable
\SCALA{status} to store the status of the current exchange, one of the
following: 
\begin{description}
\item[{\scalashape Empty}:] No sender has deposited a value;
\item[{\scalashape Filled}:] A sender has deposited a value, but no receiver
  has yet read it;
\item[{\scalashape Read}:] A receiver has read the current value, but the
  corresponding sender has not yet returned.
\end{description}
%
The implementation also uses a variable |receiversWaiting|, which records how
many receivers are currently waiting to receive a value. 

A sender waits (on a condition \SCALA{slotEmptied}) until the status is
\SCALA{Empty}.  It then stores its value in |value|, sets the status to
|Filled|, and signals (on a condition |slotFull|) to a receiver.  It next 
waits (on a condition |continue|) until the status is |Read|.  Finally, it
sets the status back to |Empty|, and signals (on |slotEmptied|) to the next
sender.

A receiver waits (on |slotFull|) until the status is |Filled| (updating
|receiversWaiting| before and after).  It then sets the status to |Read|,
signals to the sender (on |continue|), and returns the value stored in
|value|.

We now outline the CSP model.  The model uses small fixed types representing
the type of data communicated by the channel, and the type of thread
identities.  We discuss the choices for these types later. 

The monitor is modelled by a CSP module, encapsulating a process that
maintains the state of the monitor, specifically: (1)~which thread, if any,
holds the lock on the monitor; and (2)~which threads are waiting on which
conditions.  When no thread holds the lock, the monitor process allows a
thread, other than any of the waiting threads, to acquire the lock.  The
thread that currently holds the lock can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Release the lock;
\item Wait on a condition, at which point it also releases the lock;
\item Signal on a condition, at which point a thread that it waiting on that
  condition is recorded as no longer waiting (but needs to reacquire the lock
  before it can continue).
\end{itemize}
%
The monitor module provides an interface to client processes corresponding to
the different monitor operations.

Each variable in the implementation of the channel is modelled by a CSP
process, with CSP channels to allow the variable's value to be read or
written.

Each of the send (``|!|'') and receive (``|?|'') operations can then be
straightforwardly translated into a CSP process that performs the operations
on the monitor and variables, following the Scala code.  (The appendix
describes various techniques that we found useful in this modelling.)

The Scala code uses several assertions.  We model these by having the CSP
process diverge if the property does not hold.  Later, we use FDR to verify
that such divergences do not occur.  

Each operation is framed by \CSPM{begin} and \CSPM{end} events:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The event \CSPM{beginSend.t.x} represents a thread with
  identity~\CSPM{t} calling |!x| on the channel, and the event
  \CSPM{endSend.t.SendSuccess} represents it successfully returning (later we
  extend the channel to model unsuccessful calls that find the channel has
  been closed).

\item Likewise the events \CSPM{beginReceive.t} and
  \CSPM{endReceive.t.ReceiveSuccess.x} represent thread~\CSPM{t} calling and
  returning from an invocation of the receive operation that successfully
  receives the value~\CSPM{x}.
\end{itemize}
%
Inside the channel module is a process corresponding to each thread, which
accepts the \CSPM{begin} events, simulates the operation, and then performs
the appropriate \CSPM{end} event.  The module encapsulates this so only the
\CSPM{begin} and \CSPM{end} events are visible.  A process outside the module
can simulate calling the operation by synchronising on those events.

\subsection{Analysing the basic channel}

We now analyse the basic model of the channel.  We start by describing
abstractly the property that we expect to hold, and then describe how to
capture it using CSP.

Each invocation of the send operation should synchronise with a corresponding
invocation of receive: the two invocations should overlap in time, and
the receive should return the value of the send's parameter.  

In~\cite{LL:synchronisation}, we introduced a correctness condition,
\emph{synchronisation linearisation}, corresponding to synchronisation objects
like this.  The idea is that each synchronisation should appear to take place
between the begin and end of the two corresponding invocations; different
synchronisations should occur in a one-at-a-time order.  We call the points at
which the synchronisations appear to take place \emph{synchronisation points}.
(The definition is based on \emph{linearisation}, the standard correctness
property for concurrent datatypes, where invocations of operations should
appear to take place in a one-at-a-time order, with each between the begin and
end of that invocation.)

The diagram below illustrates the idea; it illustrates a particular history
of a channel (or a trace of the CSP model).

Time goes from left to right in the diagram.  Each horizontal line represents
an invocation, with the end points representing the call and return (or
\CSPM{begin} and \CSPM{end} events).  The ``$\cross$''s in the diagram
illustrate the synchronisation points of the corresponding invocations, linked
by a dashed vertical line.

Thus a history (or trace) is synchronisation linearisable if it is possible to
identify synchronisation points with the desired properties.  This corresponds
to identifying which invocations synchronise with one another.  A
synchronisation object is synchronisation linearisable if all of its histories
are synchronisation linearisable~\cite{LL:synchronisation}.

%% The current model of the channel is (in the terminology
%% of~\cite{LL:synchronisation}) \emph{stateless}: no state is carried forward
%% from one synchronisation to another.  However, when we consider closing of the
%% channel, it will become \emph{stateful}, with two states, open or closed.
%% Other synchronisation objects have more interesting states.  \framebox{later?}

\inlineCSP

We now describe how we use model checking to test synchronisation
linearisability of the channel.  We create an instance |C| of the channel
module.  Below, expressions of the form |C::v| represent a value~|v| from this
instance.  We create a process |System| that allows threads to call the send
and receive operations.

We build a CSP specification process that allows precisely the traces that are
synchronisation linearisable.  We use events of the form
\CSPM{sync.t}$_1$\CSPM{.t}$_2$\CSPM{.x} to represent a synchronisation point
between sender~$\CSPMM{t}_1$ and receiver~$\CSPMM{t}_2$, passing data
value~|x|.  We build a \emph{lineariser} process for each thread as follows,
which ensures that the |sync| events occur between the corresponding |begin|
and |end| events.
%
\begin{cspm}
Lin(t) = 
  C::beginSend.t?x -> sync.t?other!x -> C::endSend.t.SendSuccess -> Lin(t)
  [] C::beginReceive.t -> sync?other!t?x -> C::endReceive.t.ReceiveSuccess.x -> Lin(t)
\end{cspm}
%
When sending, the thread can synchronise with any other thread~|other|,
passing its value~|x|.  When receiving, the thread can synchronise with any
other thread, accepting that thread's value~|x|; this |x| is subsequently
returned by the invocation.

We combine the |Lin| processes in parallel, with their natural
alphabets, so the linearisers for threads $\CSPMM{t}_1$ and $\CSPMM{t}_2$
synchronise on events of \CSPM{sync.t}$_1$\CSPM{.t}$_2$ and
\CSPM{sync.t}$_2$\CSPM{.t}$_1$.  
%
\begin{cspm}
alphaLin(t) =
  {|C::beginSend.t, C::endSend.t, C::beginReceive.t, C::endReceive.t|} £$\union$£
  {|sync.t.other, sync.other.t | other <- ThreadID-{t}|}
Spec£$_0$£ = **|| t <- ThreadID @ [alphaLin(t)] Lin(t)
\end{cspm} % £$\union$£
%
Thus each trace of |Spec|$_0$ represents a history that is synchronisation
linearisable, together with the corresponding synchronisation points.  By
hiding the synchronisation points, we obtain a process whose traces represent
precisely those histories that are synchronisation linearisable.  We can then
use FDR to check that the system is synchronisation linearisable. 
%
\begin{cspm}
Spec = Spec£$_0$£ \ {|sync|}
assert Spec [T= System
\end{cspm}

We can also test the same refinement in the stable failures model (which
implies the refinement in the traces model).
%
\begin{cspm}
assert Spec [F= System
\end{cspm}
%
This captures a useful progress property, which says that if a synchronisation
is possible (i.e.~there is at least one |send| and one |receive| operation
that have been called but not yet returned), then some such synchronisation
must happen, and so the relevant threads reach a state where they can return.  
(If several different synchronisations are possible, then the refinement test
allows any to happen.)  We call this property \emph{synchronisation
  progressiblity}. 

Finally, as discussed above, we can test that |System| does not diverge, to
verify that no thread in the implementation throws an exception.  Further,
this verifies that threads cannot perform an infinite amount of internal
activity without any thread returning.  These tests can be combined by testing
for refinement in the failures-divergences model.

\begin{cspm}
assert Spec [FD= System
\end{cspm}
