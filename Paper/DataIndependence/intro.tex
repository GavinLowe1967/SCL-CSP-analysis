This note seeks an alternative characterisation of data independence.

We consider a \CSPm\ script that is data independent in a type~$t$, including
no equality tests on values of type~$t$.  We make these requirements more
precise below.

Let $P[t]$ be a family of processes parameterised by the type~$t$.  We
consider instantiating the type parameter by two concrete types~$T_1$ and
$T_2$; we write the resulting processes as $P[T_1]$ and $P[T_2]$.  Let $f: T_1
\fun T_2$ be a surjection.  Lift $f$ to events by pointwise application; and
then lift $f$ to traces by pointwise application.  We will prove the following
results.\footnote{The notation $f\inverse \banana{X}$ represents the
  relational inverse image of~$X$ under~$f$, i.e.~$\set{y \| f(y) \in X}$.}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\traces(P[T_2]) & = & \set{f(tr) \| tr \in \traces(P[T_1])},
  \label{eqn:traces} \\
\failures(P[T_2]) & = &
  \set{(f(tr), X) \| (tr, f\inverse \banana{X}) \in \failures(P[T_1])},
  \label{eqn:failures} \\
\divergences(P[T_2]) & = & \set{f(tr) \| tr \in \divergences(P[T_1])}.
\end{eqnarray}

We now discuss the restrictions we need to place on the usage of~$t$, and of
elements of~$t$, in order to obtain these results.  First, what can we do with
the type $t$ itself?  Figure~\ref{fig:t-allowed} gives some examples.
\framebox{\ldots} 

\begin{definition}
We can that a set or type is \emph{built from~$t$} if
%
\begin{itemize}
\item It is $t$ itself;

\item It is declared as a \CSPM{datatype}, and one of the branches uses a set
  built from $t$;

\item It is defined using a set comprehension, and one of the generators is
  over a set built from~$t$;

\item It is defined in terms of a channel that is built from~$t$.
\end{itemize}
%
A channel is \emph{built from~$t$} if its type uses a type built from~$t$.
\end{definition}
 
%%%%%

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{cspm}
datatype Option = Some.t | None
channel in : t
channel c1 : t . Z -- Z some other set, independent of t
channel c2 : t . Option
Y = {| in |}
\end{cspm}
% T1 = { x.z | x <- t, z <- Z } -- Z some other set
\caption{Allowable uses of the data independent type $t$. \label{fig:t-allowed}}
\end{figure}

%%%%%

What can we do with a value~$v$ built from~$t$?  A process can receive a value
over a channel, nondeterministically choose a value, store a value, build and
store a new value, or send a stored value.  However, no operation can be
performed on the value~$v$ that restricts the type of~$t$: in effect, $t$~is a
free polymorphic type.

We do not allow the script to contain any constant from~$t$, other than within
the definition of the instantiation of~$t$.  \framebox{**} I
think it would be ok to allow constants as long as all instantiations contain
those constants, and we restrict to functions that are the identity on each
constant. 

Also not functions like \CSPM{seq} \framebox{\ldots}

We also do not allow any equality or inequality tests over values of type~$t$.
Consider the process
\[
c?x \then c?y \then \If x = y \Then a \then STOP \Else b \then STOP
\]
%
This does not satisfy equation~\ref{eqn:traces}.  Let $v$ and~$v'$ be distinct
elements of~$T_1$; then $tr = \trace{c.v, c.v', b} \in traces(P[T_1])$.  But
consider $f: T_1 \fun T_2$ such that $f(v) = f(v') = w$; then the
corresponding trace $f(tr) = \trace{c.w, c.w, b}$ is not a trace of
$P[T_2]$.

We allow external choices and nondeterministic choices to be indexed over a
type built from~$t$, for example~$\Intchoice x \in t \spot P(x)$.  However, we
do not allow other operators, such as parallel operators, to be indexed over a
type built from~$t$. 

When two processes synchronise on a channel built from~$t$, we require that,
for each value from~$t$ in the corresponding events, at least one of the
processes is willing to accept an arbitrary value.  For example, we allow
\[
c!x \then STOP \parallel[\eset{c}] c?y \then STOP.
\]
However, we do not allow 
\[
c!x \then STOP \parallel[\eset{c}] c!y \then STOP,
\]
for that corresponds to an equality test between~$x$ and~$y$. 


We  need to restrict operations over sets that are built from~$t$.  We
do allow sets to be built that contain values built from~$t$, and allow the
\CSPM{union} and \CSPM{empty} functions to be applied to such sets.  However,
we do not allow the function \CSPM{member} to be applied to a set built
from~$t$, because it can be used to simulate equality tests: the expression
$\CSPMM{member}(x, \set{y})$ is equivalent to $x = y$.  Likewise, we do not
allow the function \CSPM{card} to be applied to a set built from~$t$: the
expression $\CSPMM{card} \set{x,y} = 1$ is equivalent to $x = y$.  Similarly,
we do not allow pattern matching over sets built from~$t$ that are based on
the cardinality of the set.  We also do not allow the \CSPM{inter} and
\CSPM{diff} functions since (when combined with \CSPM{empty}) they can be used
to simulate equality tests.

We can build sets using comprehensions over sets based on~$t$, for example,
the set |T1| in Figure~\ref{fig:t-allowed}.  However, we cannot build
sequences in the same way.  An expression such as \CSPM{< x.3 \| x <- t >}
doesn't type check, since |t| is a set, not a sequence.  And, as noted above,
we cannot use the function |seq| to convert a set into a sequence.

We need further restrictions.  Consider the following, in addition to the
declarations in Figure~\ref{fig:t-allowed}.\footnote{The use of the
  {\cspmfont PairB} type and {\cspmfont Two} type constructor is necessary to
meet FDR's requirements that the alphabet of each channel is rectangular,
i.e.~the cartesian product of sets of complete values.}
\begin{cspm}
datatype PairB = Two.t.t.Bool
channel two : union({Two.x.x.true | x <- t}, {Two.x.y.false | x <- t, y <- t})
P = in?x -> in?y -> two.Two.x.y?b -> STOP
\end{cspm}
%
The processes $P$ do not satisfy equation~\ref{eqn:failures}, in general.
Suppose 
\[
T_1 = \set{A,B}, \quad T_2 = \set{C}, \quad f(A) = f(B) =  C.
\]
Then $P[T_1]$ has a failure
\[
(\trace{\M{in}.A, \M{in}.B},\; 
  \set{\M{two.Two}.x.y.\M{true} \| x \in \set{A,B}, y \in \set{A,B}}),
\]
because, after that trace, the ``|?b|'' ranges over $\set{\M{false}}$.  
However,  $P[T_2]$ does not have the corresponding failure
\[
(\trace{\M{in}.C, \M{in}.C},\; \set{\M{two.Two}.C.C.\M{true}}),
\]
because, after that trace, the ``|?b|'' ranges over $\set{\M{true,false}}$.
In effect, the declaration of the type of~|two| has introduced an equality
test: the ``|?b|'' is equivalent to 
``\CSPM{?b:(if x==y then \{true,false\} else \{false\})}'', which is not
allowed because of the equality test. 

I think we probably want to restrict set comprehensions so that each name that
is bound by a generator over a set built from~$t$ is used at more once.  This
would ban the expression \CSPM{\{Two.x.x.true \| x <- t\}} that caused
problems above. 
%
Note we also prevent such bound names appearing within the range of another
generator, to prevent expressions such as  
\CSPM{\{Two.x.y.true \| x <- t, y <- \{x\}\}}.

We restrict all channel declarations
\begin{cspm}
channel c : A£$_1$£ . £\ldots£ . A£$_k$£
\end{cspm}
and all branches of datatypes
\begin{cspm}
datatype D = £\ldots£ | C . A£$_1$£ . £\ldots£ . A£$_k$£
\end{cspm}
such that each set |A|$_i$ is either:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item a set that is independent of~$t$; 

\item a datatype; or

\item an expression of the form $\eset{C_1, \ldots, C_j}$, where $C_1, \ldots,
  C_j$ are constructors of some datatype.
\end{itemize}

Conjecture: for every top-level set-valued expression $e$ in the script,
\[
\eval ~ \rho_1 ~ e = f\inverse \banana{\eval ~ (f\after\rho_1)~e}.
\]
Prove that if $\rho(x) = f\inverse \banana{f(\rho(x))}$ for every identifier~$x$
associated with a set, then the above holds for~$\rho$.  Effectively this
means piece-wise symmetric in~$t$.
