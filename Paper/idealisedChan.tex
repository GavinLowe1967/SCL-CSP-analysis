\subsection{Idealised model of a channel}

We now give an idealised model of a channel: this describes the behaviour of a
channel in terms of the calls and returns of functions, while abstracting away
from the implementation.  We assume (for simplicity) a single thread,
|AltThread|, that runs any alt that interacts with the channel.

\textbf{Key.}  We use BNF-style notation to capture
channels with similar names; for example, we write
``\CSPM{(begin}\m\CSPM{end)Send}'' to denote the \CSPM{beginSend} and
\CSPM{endSend} channels.  The interface with an alt appears on the left; the
interface with channel-threads appears on the right; error events appear
below; internal events appear inside the box.

The construction is made more complicated by the fact that the model needs to
deal with the |begin| and |end| events for function calls, whereas these
functions will take effect at their linearisation points.  To deal with this,
we construct the model from several components, as depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:idealised-chan}.  The component |ChanState| keeps track of the
state of the channel: whether an alt is registered at a port, and whether the
channel is closed.  The component |RegLin| is responsible for linearising
registrations and deregistrations.  Each component |Lin(t)| is responsible for
linearising the function calls of channel-thread~|t|.  We describe these in
more detail below.  Some details of the definitions are unobvious, and were
found by trial and error: their correctness is evidenced by the subsequent
successful refinement checks.

%%%%%

\paragraph{The {\cspmstyle RegLin} process.}

The |RegLin| process is defined in Figure~\ref{fig:RegLin}; it accepts the
relevant |begin| events, with each function being handled by a different
subsidiary process. 

The process |RegLinRegIn(alt, index)| models the linearisation of a call of
\SCALA{registerIn(alt, index)}, which can happen in several ways.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A synchronisation with a waiting \SCALA{send} by a channel thread~|t|,
  with the alt receiving~|x|, is modelled by~|registerInSync.t.x|;
  this synchronises with the corresponding |Lin(t)| process.

\item An unsuccessful registration is modelled by
  |registerIn|\-|Wait.alt.index|.

\item A registration that finds the channel closed is modelled by an event
  |isClosed.AltThread|.

\item An incorrect registration, where an alt is already registered, is
  modelled by the event |registerError|.
\end{itemize}
% 
The |ChanState| process synchronises on each of these events, to make sure the
correct one is selected, based on the current channel state. 

The process |RegLinRegOut(alt, index)| models the linearisation of a call of
\SCALA{registerOut(alt, index)}, in a similar way.  The processes
|RegLin|\-|DeregIn(alt, index)| and |RegLinDeregOut(alt, index)| model
deregistrations, including the possibility of an erroneous deregistration.

\caption{Definition of the {\scalashape Lin} processes, controlling
  channel-thread functions.  \label{fig:Lin}}
\end{figure}

%%%%%

\paragraph{The {\cspmstyle Lin} processes.}

The |Lin(t)| processes are defined in Figure~\ref{fig:Lin}.  Each accepts the
relevant \SCALA{begin} and \SCALA{end} events from channel-thread~|t|, with
most of the functions modelled by subsidiary processes.

The process |SendingLin| models the linearisation of the \SCALA{send} and
\SCALA{sendWithin} functions; the parameter |timed| indicates the latter case.
The subprocess |Success| indicates a successful send.  There are several
cases.  The |ChanState| process synchronises on the relevant events to ensure
an appropriate one is selected.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A synchronisation with another channel thread~|t'| is represented by the
  event |sync.t.t'.x|.  In the implementation, thread~|t| might not be able to
  return immediately: it must first obtain the lock.  This is modelled here by
  a synchronisation on event |commit.t| with |ChanState|, which might be
  blocked in some circumstances.

\item A synchronisation with an alt performing \SCALA{registerIn} is captured
  by the event |registerInSync.t.x|, described earlier.  Again, the thread~|t|
  might not be able to return immediately, as modelled here by a
  synchronisation on |commit.t|.

\item A decision to call |maybeReceive| on an alt~|alt| registered with
  index~|index| is modelled by the event |callMaybeReceive.t.alt.index.x|;
  this event is a synchronisation with |ChanState|, which allows it only when
  |alt| is suitably registered.  Thread~|t| then calls |maybeReceive|, waits
  to receive back the result, and reacts accordingly.

\item The thread can find the channel closed via the event |isClosed.t|.

\item In the case of the |sendWithin| function, the thread can timeout,
  modelled by the event |timeout.t|.  
\end{itemize}

The process |ReceivingLin| models the linearisation of the \SCALA{receive} and
\SCALA{receiveWithin}, in a similar way.  There is no need for the extra
synchronisation on the |commit| channel in this case: in the implementation,
these functions can return straightaway after synchronisation. 

Finally, the |Lin| processes directly deal with closing.  The event |close.t|
represents the linearisation point of the operation.  The \SCALA{close}
function might not be able to return immediately: the channel might need to
call \SCALA{portClosed} on a registered port (modelled within |ChanState|),
and wait for that call to return; the event |isClosed.t| becomes available at
that point.

  )
\end{cspm}
\caption{The {\scalashape ChanState} process.  \label{fig:ChanState}}
\end{figure}

%%%%%

\paragraph{The {\cspmstyle ChanState} process.}

The |ChanState| process is in Figure~\ref{fig:ChanState}.  The parameter
|regStatus| records the current registration status, and is taken from the
following type.
%
\begin{cspm}
datatype RegStatus = NoReg | InReg.AltID.Index | OutReg.AltID.Index
\end{cspm}
%
where |AltID| is the type of alt identities, and |Index| is the type of
indices of branches.  The subtypes of |RegStatus| represent that no alt is
currently registered, or that an alt is registered at the inport or outport
corresponding to a particular index.  

In the definition of |ChanState|, the values |regIns| and |regOuts| store the
(empty or singleton) sets of |AltID.Index| pairs corresponding to
registrations at the inport or outport, respectively (these are calculated
using straightforward helper functions).

Several possibilities are available when there is no registered alt.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A \SCALA{registerIn} or \SCALA{registerOut} operation may synchronise
  with a waiting channel thread.

\item A \SCALA{registerIn} or \SCALA{registerOut} operation may fail to
  synchronise; the registration status is updated appropriately.

\item A \SCALA{deregisterIn} or \SCALA{deregisterOut} operation may happen;
  which has no effect.  These events can arise if an alt is trying to
  deregister concurrently with an unsuccessful call back of
  \SCALA{maybeReceive} or \SCALA{maybeSend} that clears the registration
  status. 
\end{itemize}

Several possibilities are available when there is a registered alt.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Another registration attempt would be erroneous, represented by the
  event |registerError|.

\item The currently registered alt might be deregistered.

\item An attempt to deregister a different alt would be erroneous (here
  |AltIndex| represents the set of all |AltID.Index| pairs).

\item A channel thread~|t| may decide to call \SCALA{maybeReceive} or
  \SCALA{maybeSend} corresponding to the current registration.  The call is
  made and returns, and the registration is cleared (regardless of the
  result). 
\end{itemize}
%
Note that other events are blocked during calls to \SCALA{maybeReceive} or
\SCALA{maybeSend}; this corresponds to the fact that in the implementation,
the relevant channel-thread keeps the lock on the channel.

Other possibilities are available regardless of the registration status.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Two threads~|t1| and |t2| may synchronise on a communication.

\item A sending thread~|t| may commit to returning (see the earlier
  explanation concerning the |Lin(t)| process). 

\item A channel-thread in a \SCALA{sendWithin} or \SCALA{receiveWithin} can
  timeout. 

\item The channel can be closed.  If there is a registered port, the channel
  calls |portClosed| on the relevant alt, and waits for it to return.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%

\begin{figure}
\begin{cspm}
ChanStateClosed = 
  isClosed?t -> ChanStateClosed
  [] close?t -> ChanStateClosed
  [] commit?t -> ChanStateClosed
  [] deregisterIn?alt?index -> ChanStateClosed
  [] deregisterOut?alt?index -> ChanStateClosed
\end{cspm}
\caption{The {\scalashape ChanStateClosed}
  process.  \label{fig:ChanStateClosed}}
\end{figure}

%%%%%

The process~|ChanStateClosed| in Figure~\ref{fig:ChanStateClosed} corresponds
to the channel having been closed.  
%
\begin{itemize}
\item This process can perform |inClosed.t|, synchronising with either
  |RegLin| (if |t| is the alt-thread) or |Lin(t)|, as described earlier.

\item The channel could be closed again (having no effect).

\item The process could synchronise with a |Lin(t)| process on event
  |commit.t|: this corresponds to sending thread~|t| having synchronised with
  another thread before the channel was closed. 

\item A deregistration may happen, which has no effect: this corresponds to
  the alt-thread starting the deregistration concurrently with the callback of
  |portClosed|. 
\end{itemize}

The components are combined together as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:idealised-chan}, hiding all the internal events (those inside
the box in the figure).  This produces a process |IdealisedChannel|.  Recall
that we want to allow arbitrary behaviour after one of the events that
represents that the environment has not followed the alt protocol, on channels
|registerError|, |deregisterInError| and |deregisterOutError|.  In the
stable-failures model, the process |CHAOS(Interface)| allows arbitrary
behaviour over the set |Interface| (the interface of the channel); in the
failures-divergences model, the process |DIV| allows arbitrary behaviour.  We
therefore define the following.
%
\begin{cspm}
Errors£$_C$£ = {|registerError, deregisterInError, deregisterOutError|}
ChannelSpec£$_F$£ = (IdealisedChannel [|Errors£$_C$£|> CHAOS(Interface) ) \ Errors£$_C$£
ChannelSpec£$_D$£ = (IdealisedChannel [|Errors£$_C$£|> DIV ) \ Errors£$_C$£
\end{cspm}

We can then compare the CSP model of a synchronous channel implementation
against the idealised model.  We create a system using the model of the
implementation, allowing threads to call appropriate operations.  We can then
verify that this system refines |ChannelSpec|$_F$ and |ChannelSpec|$_D$ in the
relevant models.


\begin{window}[0,r,{
%

\end{tabular}
},]
%
The table to the right gives statistics about the number of states explored
and the times taken to perform these checks, in different models; in each
case, one thread was an alt-thread and the remainder where channel-threads.
\framebox{***} With five threads, the check in the failures-divergences model
runs out of memory post compilation.
\end{window}
 
Interestingly, the failures-divergences check is faster than the
stable-failures model: normally, it is the other way round.  The difference in
time is because of the time taken to normalise the specification.  This step
builds an automaton equivalent to the specification, but with the property
that after each trace, a unique state is reached; if, after trace~$tr$, the
specification can reach states~$st_1,\ldots,st_k$, then the normalised
automaton contains a corresponding state equivalent to $st_1$ \CSPM{\|~\|}
\ldots \CSPM{\|~\|} $st_k$.  Consider the case where the trace~$tr$ might have
included an error event.  In the failures-divergences model, the resulting
normalised state includes |DIV|, and the normalisation algorithm identifies
that the normalised state is precisely equal to |DIV|, and so does not need to
expand its successor states.  However, in the stable-failures model, this is
not the case, so the normalisation algorithm does construct those successor
states.  It is straightforward to show that the failures-divergences check
implies the corresponding stable-failures check, because |IdealisedChan| is
divergence-free.
