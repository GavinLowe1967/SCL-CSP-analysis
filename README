Files marked with "*" are top-level files, containing refinement checks.

Building blocks
---------------

Macros.csp: generic helpful macros.

Types.csp: types returned by various functions.

Variable.csp: model of a variable.

JVMMonitor.csp: model of a JVM monitor.

MonitorCondition.csp: model of an SCL monitor.

SCL Components
--------------

ChannelInterface.csp: the interface of a channel.

AltInterface.csp: the interface of an alt. 

NewSyncChan.csp

Alt.csp

SyncChanTest.csp: test upon synchronous channel, without alts


Combined tests
--------------

These directly test a combination of an alt and channels.

CombinedTestSingle.csp: test of an alt with a single branch.

CombinedTest.csp: test of an alt with two branches.

CombinedSpec.csp: most of the specification (also used in
CompositionalTest.csp)


Idealised models and tests
--------------------------

IdealisedAlt.csp: idealised model of an alt.

IdealisedAltTest.csp: test of an Alt against IdealisedAlt.

IdealisedChan.csp: idealised model of a channel 

IdealisedChanTest.csp: test of a channel against IdealisedChan

CompositionalTest*.csp: test of the combination of an IdealisedAlt and
IdealisedChans. 

IdealisedChan2.csp: experimental model, trying to detect errors earlier.  Not working. 


TODO NEXT

Current experiment: have alt hold lock during registration.  Have callbacks
assert !registering.  **Make these changes in implementation**

Continue checking NewSyncChan, interaction with alts.

Test Scala code.
