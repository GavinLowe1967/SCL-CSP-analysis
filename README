Note: the analysis contains a lot of files, so as to keep the different parts
separate.  This means that most files import othre files, to avoid repeated
code.  The description below describes each file.  Files marked with "*" are
top-level files, containing refinement checks.


Building blocks
---------------

Macros.csp: generic helpful macros; some are described in Appendix A.

Types.csp: defines various types, including values returned by various
functions.

Variable.csp: model of a variable, as described in Section 3 and Appendix A.

MonitorCondition.csp: model of an SCL monitor, as described in Section 3. 

JVMMonitor.csp: model of a JVM monitor, as described in Section 4.3.

* Conditions.csp: an analysis of SCL Conditions.  Not included in the paper. 

SCL Components
--------------

SyncChan0.csp: the simplified channel from the start of Section 3.

* SyncChanTest0.csp: test on the simplified channel, as decribed in Section
3.2.

ChanInterface.csp: the interface of a channel.

AltInterface.csp: the interface of an alt. 

SyncChan.csp: the model of a synchronous channel, as described in Section 3.

Alt.csp: the model of an alt, as described in Section 4.

* SyncChanTest.csp: test upon synchronous channel, without alts, as decribed in
Section 3, with results in Section 3.3.


Combined tests
--------------

These directly test a combination of an alt and channels, as described in
Section 4.4

CombinedSpec.csp: most of the specification (also used in
CompositionalTest.csp)

* CombinedTestSingle.csp: test of an alt with a single branch.

* CombinedTest.csp: test of an alt with two branches.  Results reported in
Section 4.4.


Idealised models and tests
--------------------------

These described the compositional verification approach from Section 5. 

IdealisedChan.csp: idealised model of a channel, as described in Section 5.1.

* IdealisedChanTest.csp: test of a channel against IdealisedChan, as described
(with results) in Section 5.1.

IdealisedAlt.csp: idealised model of an alt, as described in Section 5.2.

* IdealisedAltTest.csp: test of an Alt against IdealisedAlt, as described
(with results) in Section 5.2.

CompositionalTest.csp: framework for testing the combination of an
IdealisedAlt and some number of IdealisedChans.  Can be imported into other
files that defined the IDealisedChans themselves.

* CompositionalTest2.csp: test of the combination of an IdealisedAlt and two
IdealisedChans, as described (with results) in Section 5.23.
